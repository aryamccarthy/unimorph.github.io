<h1>Schema</h1>
<p>
  The UniMorph schema comprises 23 dimensions of meaning and over 212
  features. The dimensions of meaning are morphological categories, such
  as person, number, tense, and aspect, which each represent a coherent
  semantic space within inflectional morphology. They include:
  Aktionsart, animacy, aspect, case, comparison, definiteness, deixis,
  evidentiality, finiteness, gender, information structure,
  interrogatively, mood, number, part of speech, person, polarity,
  politeness, switch-reference, tense, valency, and voice. These
  dimensions contain varying numbers of features, from just 2 for
  finiteness to 39 for case. Features represent the finest-grained
  distinctions in meaning that are possible within a given dimension.

Each inflected word in any given language is represented by its
lemma (as might appear in a dictionary, for example) and a
bundle of UniMorph features.

For example, the Spanish
word <em>hablaste</em> can be represented as the lemma
<em>hablar</em> plus the bundle [<font style="font-variant:small-caps">fin</font>;
<font style="font-variant:small-caps">ind</font>;
<font style="font-variant:small-caps">pfv</font>;
<font style="font-variant:small-caps">pst</font>;
<font style="font-variant:small-caps">2</font>;
<font style="font-variant:small-caps">sg</font>;
<font style="font-variant:small-caps">infm</font>].
More forms are listed in Figure 1. The abbreviations
are as follows: <font style="font-variant:small-caps">fin</font> indicates a finite verb, <font style="font-variant:small-caps">ind</font> indicates the
indicative mood, <font style="font-variant:small-caps">pfv</font> indicates the perfective aspect, <font style="font-variant:small-caps">pst</font> indicate the
past tense, <font style="font-variant:small-caps">2</font> indicates the second person, <font style="font-variant:small-caps">sg</font> indicates the singular
number, and <font style="font-variant:small-caps">infm</font> indicates the informal register. Note that this
yields a mapping, which associates the entire inflected word with its
meaning without any indication of the morpheme divisions (or segments)
within <em>hablaste</em> nor how the UniMorph schema features are distributed
among those divisions. In other words, this is a paradigmatic
treatment of morphology in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(linguistics)#Word-based_morphology">word-based</a> tradition (<a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/word-formation-generative-grammar">Aronoff
1976</a>). The Russian word <em>сказал</em> has a very similar representation as the lemma <em>сказать</em> plus the bundle [<font style="font-variant:small-caps">fin</font>;
<font style="font-variant:small-caps">ind</font>;
<font style="font-variant:small-caps">pfv</font>;
<font style="font-variant:small-caps">pst</font>;
<font style="font-variant:small-caps">2</font>;
<font style="font-variant:small-caps">sg</font>;
<font style="font-variant:small-caps">infm</font>;
<font style="font-variant:small-caps">masc</font>],
differing from <em>hablaste</em> only in the
fact that it additionally marks
the gender feature. We remark that the Russian past tense is a case
of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncretism_(linguistics)">syncretism</a>
in that one form has many possible tags&mdash;a context is required to
disambiguate. See Figure 1 for a comparison between Spanish and
Russian.  Note that for both languages, the representation differs
only by what distinctions in meaning the language marks. Because the
meaning of features does not differ across languages, the featural
representation of words from different languages is directly
comparable. This is an essential feature of the UniMorph that allows
inflectional material to be faithfully translated and enhances
comparability across languages.
