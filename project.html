<h1>UniMorph</h1>
<p>
  The Universal Morphology (UniMorph) project is
  a collaborative effort to improve how human language technology,
  including machine translation, processes complex morphology in the
  world's languages, particularly those which are low-resource. The
  goal of UniMorph is to annotate morphological data in a universal
  schema that allows an inflected word from any language to be
  defined by its lexical meaning (typically carried in the root or
  stem) and by a rendering of its inflectional form in terms of
  features from the schema (i.e., a bundle of universal
  morphological features). Although building an cross-lingual
  representation for the semantic content of human language as a
  whole is typically seen as prohibitively difficult, the
  comparatively small extent of grammatical meanings that are
  conveyed by overt, affixal inflectional morphology places a
  natural bound on the range of meaning that must be expressed by an
  interlingua for inflectional morphology. A full specification of
  the schema is
  discussed <a href="doc/unimorph-schema.pdf">Sylak-Glassman (2016)</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The UniMorph schema comprises 23 dimensions of meaning and over 212
  features. The dimensions of meaning are morphological categories, such
  as person, number, tense, and aspect, which each represent a coherent
  semantic space within inflectional morphology. They include:
  Aktionsart, animacy, aspect, case, comparison, definiteness, deixis,
  evidentiality, finiteness, gender, information structure,
  interrogatively, mood, number, part of speech, person, polarity,
  politeness, switch-reference, tense, valency, and voice. These
  dimensions contain varying numbers of features, from just 2 for
  finiteness to 39 for case. Features represent the finest-grained
  distinctions in meaning that are possible within a given dimension.

Each inflected word in any given language is represented by its
lemma (as might appear in a dictionary, for example) and a
bundle of UniMorph features.

For example, the Spanish
word <em>hablaste</em> can be represented as the lemma
<em>hablar</em>+[<font style="font-variant:small-caps">fin</font>;
<font style="font-variant:small-caps">ind</font>;
<font style="font-variant:small-caps">pfv</font>;
<font style="font-variant:small-caps">pst</font>;
<font style="font-variant:small-caps">2</font>;
<font style="font-variant:small-caps">sg</font>;
<font style="font-variant:small-caps">infm</font>].
More forms are listed in Figure 1. The abbreviations
are as follows: <font style="font-variant:small-caps">fin</font> indicates a finite verb, <font style="font-variant:small-caps">ind</font> indicates the
indicative mood, <font style="font-variant:small-caps">pfv</font> indicates the perfective aspect, <font style="font-variant:small-caps">pst</font> indicate the
past tense, <font style="font-variant:small-caps">2</font> indicates the second person, <font style="font-variant:small-caps">sg</font> indicates the singular
number, and <font style="font-variant:small-caps">infm</font> indicates the informal register. Note that this
yields a mapping, which associates the entire inflected word with its
meaning without any indication of the morpheme divisions (or segments)
within hablaste nor how the UniMorph Schema features are distributed
among those divisions. In other words, this is a paradigmatic
treatment of morphology in the word-based traditional (<a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/word-formation-generative-grammar">Aronoff
1976</a>). The Russian word <em>сказал</em> has a very similar representation as <em>сказать</em>+[<font style="font-variant:small-caps">fin</font>;
<font style="font-variant:small-caps">ind</font>;
<font style="font-variant:small-caps">pfv</font>;
<font style="font-variant:small-caps">pst</font>;
<font style="font-variant:small-caps">2</font>;
<font style="font-variant:small-caps">sg</font>;
<font style="font-variant:small-caps">infm</font>;
<font style="font-variant:small-caps">masc</font>],
differing from <em>hablaste</em> only in the
fact that it additionally marks
the gender feature. We remark that the Russian past tense is a case of syncretism in that one form has many possible tags&mdash;a context is required
to disambiguate. See Figure 1 for a comparison Note that
for both languages, the representation differs only by what
distinctions in meaning the language marks. Because the meaning of
features does not differ across languages, the featural representation
of words from different languages is directly comparable. This is an
essential feature of the UniMorph that allows inflectional
material to be faithfully translated and enhances comparability across
languages.
