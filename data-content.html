    <h1>UniMorph</h1>
  <p>
  The Universal Morphology (UniMorph) project is a collaborative
  effort to improve how NLP handles complex morphology in the world's
  languages. The goal of UniMorph is to annotate morphological data in
  a universal schema that allows an inflected word from any language
  to be defined by its lexical meaning, typically carried by the
  lemma, and by a rendering of its inflectional form in terms of a
  bundle of morphological features from our schema. The specification
  of the schema is given
  in <a href="doc/unimorph-schema.pdf">Sylak-Glassman (2016)</a>. Our
  data have already been employed in two shared tasks in the NLP
  community:
  the <a href="http://ryancotterell.github.io/sigmorphon2016/">SIGMORPHON
  2016 shared task</a> and
  the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/conll-sigmorphon2017/">CoNLL-SIGMORPHON
  2017</a> shared task.

<h2>Annotated Languages</h2>
<p>The following 51 languages have been annotated according to the UniMorph schema. In some cases, parts of speech are missing from the annotations; these will be filled in as soon possible. </p>
