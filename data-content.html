    <h1>UniMorph</h1>
  <p>
  The Universal Morphology (UniMorph) project is a collaborative
  effort to improve how NLP handles complex morphology in the world's
  languages. The goal of UniMorph is to annotate morphological data in
  a universal schema that allows an inflected word from any language
  to be defined by its lexical meaning, typically carried by the
  lemma, and by a rendering of its inflectional form in terms of a
  bundle of morphological features from our schema. The specification
  of the schema is described <a href="schema.html">here</a> and
  in <a href="doc/unimorph-schema.pdf">Sylak-Glassman (2016)</a>.
